# ROCm Archlinux Packages

ROCm driver for OpenCL computations on ArchLinux.

Disclaimer: These packages are not tested well, as I am still learning while
going along with the build process. Currently the manual build process is only
documented very sparingly and only debian pkgs are available for ROCm 1.7
